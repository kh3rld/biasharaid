## Architecture

### Overview

The application is built using a modular architecture, separating concerns into different packages and directories. The main components include the blockchain logic, HTTP handlers, routing, and HTML rendering.

### Components

#### blockchain/

- **Purpose:** Contains the core logic for the blockchain implementation.
- **File:** `blockchain.go` - Implements blockchain functionalities such as initialization and data loading.

#### internals/

- **Purpose:** Houses internal packages that include handlers, renders, and routes.
- **Subdirectories:**
  - **handlers/**: Contains HTTP handlers.
    - **File:** `handlers.go` - Defines handlers for different HTTP endpoints.
  - **renders/**: Manages rendering of HTML templates.
    - **File:** `render.go` - Contains logic for rendering HTML templates.
  - **routes/**: Registers and manages HTTP routes.
    - **File:** `routes.go` - Defines and registers application routes and middleware.

#### views/

- **Purpose:** Holds static assets (CSS) and HTML templates.
- **Subdirectories:**
  - **static/**: Contains CSS files for styling the web pages.
    - **Files:** Various CSS files like `400.css`, `404.css`, `500.css`, etc., each providing styles for specific pages.
  - **templates/**: Contains HTML templates for different pages.
    - **Files:** Templates like `400.page.html`, `404.page.html`, `500.page.html`, etc., each defining the structure of specific web pages.

#### web/

- **Purpose:** Contains the main application logic and temporary files.
- **Subdirectories:**
  - **tmp/**: Used for temporary files.
  - **main.go**: The entry point of the application that initializes and starts the server.

#### Project Root Files

- **.air.toml:** Configuration file for the Air live reload tool.
- **.gitignore:** Specifies which files and directories to ignore in Git.
- **data.json:** JSON file containing initial data for the blockchain.
- **go.mod:** Go module file that defines the module path and dependencies.
- **go.sum:** Checksums for the dependencies.
- **README.md:** Documentation file providing an overview of the project.

### Data Flow

1. **Initialization:**
   - The blockchain is initialized and data is loaded from `data.json`.

2. **Request Handling:**
   - HTTP requests are routed to appropriate handlers defined in `internals/handlers/handlers.go`.

3. **Response Generation:**
   - Handlers interact with the blockchain logic and render appropriate HTML templates or JSON responses.

### Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Go
- **Web Framework:** net/http
- **Blockchain Library:** Custom implementation (`github.com/kh3rld/biasharaid/blockchain`)

### Deployment

1. **Development:**
   - Local setup using Go tools and Air for live reloading.

2. **Staging:**
   - Deployed on a staging server for testing.

3. **Production:**
   - Deployed on a production server with load balancing and scaling mechanisms.

### Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding more instances of the application behind a load balancer.
- **Vertical Scaling:** Enhancing the capabilities of the existing server.

### Security

- **Authentication:** Bearer token authentication for API endpoints.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control.
- **Data Protection:** Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.

### Error Handling

- **Logging:** Errors are logged with detailed stack traces.
- **Monitoring:** Application performance and errors are monitored using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

### Performance

- **Optimization Techniques:** Efficient data structures and algorithms ensure fast processing.
- **Benchmarking:** Regular performance tests to identify and resolve bottlenecks.
